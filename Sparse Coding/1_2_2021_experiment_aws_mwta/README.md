# AWS MWTA

Basically just mwta... except I'm running this on AWS baby!!  I got my big ol GPU and 8 vCPUs just brimming to go.  Here's to hoping CuPy is faster on this setup.  I guess the only reason it wouldn't be is if there's some weird juju with cloud computing.  Anyway, I'm basically just going to run a couple experiments, and see how fast they are.
