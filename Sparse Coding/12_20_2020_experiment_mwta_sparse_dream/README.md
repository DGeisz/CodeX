# MWTA SparseDream

MWTA = Multiple Winner Takes All.  

Basically the Krotov-Hopfield network, but with multiple winners this time.  I think this is about the easiest way to get sparsity, but the ease makes it easy to understand, and I'm getting frikin tired of getting lost in the sauce of complicated update rules.
