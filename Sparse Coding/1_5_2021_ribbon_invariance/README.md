# Ribbon Invariance

This is basically the same architecture as the last experiment, (smooth collaborative invariance), but I'm training the network on a ribbon instead of a tapestry.  So basically, I'm going to pass a stream of digits in front of the network at a constant velocity from right to left.  I think this should help me understand what's going on inside my network.
