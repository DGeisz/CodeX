# Gray Cifar MWTA

Now that I've figured out how to do sparse coding with mwta learning, I'm going to apply it to gray-scale cifar10.  I really, *really* want to see what kinds of features the network learns for different numbers of winners.  There's really nothing new here in terms of algorithms, only data.  Man, I'm excited.
