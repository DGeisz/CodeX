# Topo SparseDream Mnist

Basically, I'm starting up where I left off last experiment.  TopoSparseDream worked pretty well for colored images, but it was kinda a dumpster fire for MNIST, mostly because I think I didn't make the network sparse enough.  So basically, I'm trying this architecture out again, specifically for mnist.
