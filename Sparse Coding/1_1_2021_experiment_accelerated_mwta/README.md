# Accelerated MWTA

First experiment of the New Year, baby!  Here's to hoping I build something humanity-altering before August, so I don't have to go back to school!

So in this bad boi, I'm basically just doing mwta like the last experiments, but I'm going to try out Numba, and see if I can get it to accelerate everything 10-1000x like apparently some people have been able to accomplish.  Luckily, I'm basically just doing linalg, so hopefully this will totally be in Numba's wheelhouse.
