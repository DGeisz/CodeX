# SparseDream with Lateral Inhibition

In working with sparse coding networks, it has becoming increasingly apparent that lateral inhibition is incredibly important.  Basically, what I've been seeing while working with sparsity (especially when there's lateral excitation) is that neurons tend to fire together for certain inputs.  Now, they're still firing sparsely, so the sparsity factor is being respected, but dagnabit, they're firing together.  So what I'm seeing is that instead of on a couple neurons firing for every input, it's more like all neurons firing for a couple inputs (it isn't that extreme, but you get the idea).  So basically, we need lateral inhibition to ensure that the neurons are actually firing sparsely, that is, with only a couple active for any given input.
