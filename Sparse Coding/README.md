# Sparse Coding

### Overview:

After the titanic failure of DreamFlow, I went back to the drawing board.  By that, I mean
I binged all the vs265 lectures.  Anyway, it looks like there are a couple of things that 
need to be explored. Sparse Coding is one of them.  I'm not a huge fan of probabilistic 
models, but I agree with Olshausen that the vision problem should be formulated in terms 
synthesis rather than analysis.  What I would like is a model that is able to anchor its
view in terms of a series of higher-order structures.  I think sparse coding is the way
to get there.
