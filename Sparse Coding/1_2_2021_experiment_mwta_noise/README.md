# MWTA with Noise

So I'm basically implementing mwta again, but this time I'm adding noise to the data, and seeing how the network does at finding the actual structure.  The network ideally should be able to isolate the structure of the image from the noise, which should hopefully be evident in the reconstruction, but we'll see.
