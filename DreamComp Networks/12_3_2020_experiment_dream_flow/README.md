# DreamFlow

I think this algorithm might just be nirvana.  Pretty cool that the name DreamFlow is actually
entirely unrelated to nirvana, and just so happens to sound so psychedelic.  

Basically, this mostly the same thing as DreamComp, but I just visualized it differently,
and realized that the entire algorithm can be implemented as two matrices messing with different
values. 

There's a constant flow in the network.  The forward flow predicts the presence of 
prototypes from constituents, and the backward flow predicts the presence of constituents
from prototypes.  So the network is constantly trying to find structures and try to figure 
out precisely which structures constitute higher-order structures.

It's so incredibly crazy that I'm researching this stuff around the same time in my life
when I figured out the importance of understanding the universe in terms of a hierarchy of
entities.
