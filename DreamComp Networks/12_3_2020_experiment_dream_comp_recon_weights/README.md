#DreamComp Reconstruction Weights

This inital experiment will allow me to explore one-layer, one-competition DreamComp networks
more, and will allow me to look into my hypothesis that reconstruction weights could 
potentially allow neurons to "prioritize" particular synapses more than others in finding 
correlations.  In any event, I think it would allow me to get better classification 
accuracy with my one-layer, one-competition DreamComp network.
