# Competitive Specializing Network

This is a type of winner takes all network, but instead of simply choosing 
the winner based on the vector proximity to the input, the winner is also 
chosen based on a vector's specialization and win rate to promote the diversity
of learned features and punish networks that have only several neurons winning
the majority of inputs.
