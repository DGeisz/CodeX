# Charged Competitive Specializing Network

After the overwhelming success of [the last](../11_26_2020_experiment_comp_spec_mini_batch) experiment, it's time to
see if local repulsion plays nice with the competitive specializing network.  So yeah.  Basically the entire purpose
of this experiment is to get local repulsion built into the flow.  Also I'm calling it charged because I super don't 
want to write out Competitive Specializing Network with local repulsion.
