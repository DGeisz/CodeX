# Competitive Specializing Network with Mini-batching

After the staggering success of [this experiment](../11_24_2020_experiment_competitive_specializing_network) the 
only remaining question was this: Can we make this god-algorithm better?  (There were other questions, of course.
I just like being dramatic.  For more info, check out conclusions and next steps).  The "low-hanging-fruit" answer
to that question would be "yes, mini-batch that bad boi".  So yeah.  That's what we're doing in this experiment.
