# Collaborative Auto-encoder

This architecture is a collaborative auto-encoder in which the neurons work together to create
the reconstructed output.  The neurons tend toward a configuration in which each neuron specializes
in recreating one small portion of the input, trusting other neurons to take care of other important 
parts.
