# CompSpec Networks

### Overview:
I realized it was kinda silly to still be doing all my experiments in the RQI project.  Back when
I started that project (9 days ago lol) I was still essentially trying to find excellent auto-encoders.
Suffice is to say, I don't give a single rat shit about auto-encoders.  Wow, intellij just tried to 
sensor me.  That's kinda funny.  

Anyway, what I do care about are CompSpec networks. [Here's the experiment](../Reductionist%20Quasi-Isomorphisms/11_26_2020_experiment_comp_spec_mini_batch)
where I figured out to mini-batch CompSpec networks in case you need a refresher.  Basically,
I've created an incredibly efficient network that's able to quickly find structure in data.  Awesome.

In this project, I'm going to explore different variants on my original network, and see if I can't
create something life-altering.
