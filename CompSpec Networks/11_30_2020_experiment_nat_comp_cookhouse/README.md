By NatComp, I mean natural competition.  This is a fabled type of competition where you
don't have to find an argmax, the natural winner rises to the top, and the natural losers
fall to the bottom.  Basically, it pushes winners up, and it pushes losers down.  Blessed
are those who have, for more shall be given to them.
