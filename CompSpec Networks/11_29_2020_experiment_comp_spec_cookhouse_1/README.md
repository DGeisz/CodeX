# CompSpec Cookhouse 1

Well, it's time for the first cookhouse experiment.  What is a cookhouse, you ask? Basically
a free-flowing experiment in which I cook up a bunch of new algos.  In this case, a 
bunch of variants on CompSpec that I need to check out.  

What's on the docket for this cookhouse?  CS-i2, bringing back the win-rate term, better
use of specialization, and sequential, ordered data.
