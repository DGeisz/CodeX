# CompSpec Mnist Classifier v1

This is it bois!  We're finally building a classifier with CompSpec.  Because of the law of
"everything fails almost all the time," this is probably going to suck, but hey.  You gotta 
start somewhere.  

Anyway the architecture of this network is an input layer, a hidden layer, and the classification
layer.  The hidden and classification layers are both made with CS-i (CompSpec Infilteration)
neurons.  While I would like it to be more natural, I'm basically automatically causing the correct
classification neuron to win.  If this works, then I'm going to hook up synapses to the correct
classifications.  Here's to hoping this works.
