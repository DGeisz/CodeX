# Interal Scientific Method

### Overview:

Within the visual cortex, neurons recieve noisy information about the world as 
seen from the human eyeball.  They don't get to see any ground truth, and they
must figure out what is actually structure and what is simply noise.  Additionally,
in trying to figure out what is going on in a particular aspect of an image, the visual
cortex more or less tries out various hypotheses for what is occuring in the real world, 
and picks the one that makes most sense.  This allows the visual cortex to disregard a huge
amount of redundant information, and simply focus on the areas of the input that contradict
the internal hypothesis of what the brain believes it is percieving.  This experiment focuses
on this internal scientific method that the brain performs.  As of writing this on
1/13/21, I don't really know the best strategy for imposing higher order hypotheses on
lower order neural components.  So, you best believe I'm going to find out.
