# CodeXC

### Overview
I like to think of CodeX as more than just my research repository.  It is rather an
entire methodology that extends very nicely to the study of programs.  This topic therefore
describes the tools used to make CodeX code (CodeXC) as understandable, transparent, and 
fit for study as possible.
