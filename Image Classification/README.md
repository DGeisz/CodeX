# Image Classification

### Overview
Nothing crazy new or exciting about this.  Just trying to get the computer to tell me what a particular
image is.  That's all.  That being said, my ways of going about this will probably be different from 
your vanilla DNN.  For example, first things first, I'm using CompSpec to see if I can outperform Krotov and 
Hopfield's network at MNIST classification.  I imagine I'll be doing a lot with CompSpec.  Anyway, yeah.  This
is my image classification repo.
