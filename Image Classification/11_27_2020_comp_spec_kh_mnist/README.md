## CompSpec Krotov Hopfield Mnist

Pretty much what you'd expect.  I'm benchmarking CompSpec and Charged comp spec against HopField and Krotov's 
paper, specifically with regard to MNIST.  So basically wiring CompSpec into a better classifier.  The cool thing though is that I'm finally
wiring CompSpec into TensorFlow, so hopefully that gets figured out as quickly as possible.
