# Invariant MNIST Classifier

After literally years (maybe two months) of not implementing an MNIST classifier, the time has officially come.  Basically, I'm going to implement a three-level network.  Basically sparse MWTA, Var Xi invariant, and then WTA layers.  I'm actually quite interested in figuring out how well this network actually does at classifications.  We shall see.
