# Invariant Representations

### Overview:

When objects undergo transformations, our brains are able to tell that the object 
is still present in the visual field.  How does it do that?  This project is all
about building invariant representations of the world.  I've had some success using 
the assumption that the state of the world varies smoothly as time progresses, and this
seems like a reasonable way to form correlations between different static structure 
prototypes discovered by neurons.
