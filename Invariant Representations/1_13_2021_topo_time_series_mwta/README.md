# Topo Time Series MWTA

I basically already did this in the time series mwta experiment in the Sparse Coding project, 
but I want to try it again with more neurons and stronger lateral excitation.  I think lateral 
topological connections would be very useful in allowing the network to find related prototypes.
We've already seen this is the experiment I mentioned, but again, I want to see what happens 
with more neurons than 400.
